# COMP 271 002 F17 Lab 4 (Week 6)

# Team project

Work in teams of two but run individual JShell sessions and submit individually (see details below)

# Objectives

An understanding of the following concepts and techniques:

- ADT implementation perspective
- dynamically allocated objects
- linked lists
- navigating through linked lists
- iterators
- Java asse rtions
  
# Instructions

In this lab, you will have the opportunity to look "under the hood" of linked lists by creating and manipulating nodes.
You will do this interactively using the JShell that comes with Java 9.

1. If using c9, remove Java 8 from your workspace:

      sudo apt remove -y oracle-java8-*
      sudo apt-get autoremove
      
1. Install Java 9:

  - Java 9 installation instructions for Ubuntu (applicable to your c9 workspace): http://www.webupd8.org/2015/02/install-oracle-java-9-in-ubuntu-linux.html
  - For Windows and Mac, download and install from here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk9-downloads-3848520.html
  
  This is a fairly big download, so it might take a while.

1. Create a generic node class:

      class 
      
1. Answer the following questions
